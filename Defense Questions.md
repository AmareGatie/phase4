Here are some potential questions and answers that students might encounter during a defense presentation for the Evangadi Forum project, assuming it is built using React (frontend) and Node.js (backend). These questions are designed to test their understanding of the project, technical implementation, and decision-making process.

---

### **General Project Questions**

1. **Q: What is the purpose of the Evangadi Forum project?**

   - **A:** The Evangadi Forum is a Q&A platform designed to facilitate knowledge sharing and interaction among users. It allows users to post questions, provide answers, and engage in discussions.

2. **Q: Why did you choose React for the frontend and Node.js for the backend?**

   - **A:** React was chosen for its component-based architecture, which makes it easy to build reusable UI components and manage state efficiently. Node.js was chosen for its non-blocking I/O model, which is ideal for handling multiple concurrent requests, and its compatibility with JavaScript, allowing for a unified language across the stack.

3. **Q: How did you ensure the security of user data in the application?**
   - **A:** We implemented several security measures, including:
     - Password hashing using bcrypt to securely store passwords.
     - JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for secure user authentication.
     - HTTPS to encrypt data transmission.
     - Input validation to prevent SQL injection and other attacks.

### **Backend-Specific Questions**

4. **Q: How did you design the database schema for the Q&A platform?**

   - **A:** We created three main tables:
     - `userTable`: Stores user information (e.g., username, email, password).
     - `questionTable`: Stores questions posted by users.
     - `answerTable`: Stores answers provided by users, linked to specific questions via foreign keys.
     - Relationships were established using foreign keys, and we ensured normalization to reduce redundancy.

5. **Q: How did you handle authentication in the backend?**

   - **A:** We implemented authentication using JWT. When a user logs in, the server generates a token containing the user's ID and role. This token is sent to the client and included in the headers of subsequent requests to access protected endpoints.

6. **Q: How did you optimize the database for performance?**

   - **A:** We indexed frequently queried fields (e.g., `question_id`, `user_id`) to speed up search operations. We also normalized the database to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity.

7. **Q: How did you handle errors in the backend APIs?**

   - **A:** We used middleware to catch and handle errors. For example, invalid requests return a `400 Bad Request`, unauthorized access returns a `401 Unauthorized`, and server errors return a `500 Internal Server Error`.

8. **Q: How did you implement the API endpoint to get all questions?**
   - **A:** We created a GET endpoint `/api/question` that queries the `questionTable` and returns a JSON response containing all questions and their metadata.

### **Frontend-Specific Questions**

9. **Q: How did you manage state in the React application?**

   - **A:** We used React's built-in `useState` and `useContext` hooks to manage local and global state, respectively. For example, user authentication state was managed globally using context.

10. **Q: How did you handle routing in the React application?**

    - **A:** We used `react-router-dom` to implement client-side routing. Routes were defined for pages like Home, Sign-up, Login, Question, and Answer.

11. **Q: How did you integrate the frontend with the backend APIs?**

    - **A:** We used the `fetch` API or `axios` to make HTTP requests to the backend. For example, the Sign-up component sends a POST request to `/api/register` with user details.

12. **Q: How did you ensure the responsiveness of the frontend?**

    - **A:** We used CSS Flexbox and Grid for layout design and media queries to adjust styles based on screen size. We also tested the application on different devices and browsers.

13. **Q: How did you handle form validation in the Sign-up and Login components?**

    - **A:** We used controlled components in React to manage form inputs and implemented validation logic to check for required fields, valid email formats, and password strength. Error messages were displayed dynamically.

14. **Q: How did you implement the logout functionality?**
    - **A:** We cleared the JWT token stored in the browser's local storage or context and redirected the user to the login page.

### **Advanced Questions**

15. **Q: How would you scale this application to handle more users?**

    - **A:** We could:
      - Use a load balancer to distribute traffic across multiple servers.
      - Implement database sharding or replication to handle increased data load.
      - Use caching (e.g., Redis) to reduce database queries.
      - Optimize API responses and database queries further.

16. **Q: How would you add real-time functionality, such as live updates for new answers?**

    - **A:** We could integrate WebSockets or a library like Socket.IO to enable real-time communication between the server and clients. For example, when a new answer is posted, the server broadcasts it to all connected clients.

17. **Q: How did you test the application?**

    - **A:** We tested the backend APIs using tools like Postman and wrote unit tests for critical functions. For the frontend, we used React Testing Library to test components and their behavior.

18. **Q: What challenges did you face during development, and how did you overcome them?**

    - **A:** Some challenges included:
      - Managing state across multiple components: We solved this by using React Context.
      - Handling asynchronous API calls: We used `async/await` and error handling to manage this.
      - Ensuring security: We followed best practices like hashing passwords and using HTTPS.

19. **Q: How would you deploy this application?**

    - **A:** We would deploy the backend on a cloud platform like AWS or Heroku and the frontend on a static hosting service like Netlify or Vercel. We would also configure environment variables for sensitive data like database credentials.

20. **Q: What additional features would you add to this project in the future?**
    - **A:** Some potential features include:
      - Upvoting/downvoting answers.
      - User profiles with activity history.
      - Notifications for new answers or comments.
      - Search functionality for questions and answers.
